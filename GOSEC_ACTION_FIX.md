# Gosec Action Fix Applied ✅

## 🎯 **Issue**

The GitHub Actions CI was failing with:
```
Unable to resolve action securecodewarrior/github-action-gosec@v2, action not found
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

I had used an **incorrect gosec GitHub Action** repository. The action `securecodewarrior/github-action-gosec@v2` does not exist.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

**Changed from (incorrect)**:
```yaml
- name: Run Gosec Security Scanner
  uses: securecodewarrior/github-action-gosec@v2
```

**Changed to (correct)**:
```yaml
- name: Run Gosec Security Scanner
  uses: securego/gosec@master
```

## 📋 **What Changed**

- **Repository**: `securecodewarrior/github-action-gosec` → `securego/gosec`
- **Version**: `@v2` → `@master`
- **Reason**: Using the **official gosec action** from the correct repository

## 🧪 **Verification**

The correct action `securego/gosec@master` is:
- ✅ **Official**: From the official gosec project at https://github.com/securego/gosec
- ✅ **Active**: Maintained and regularly updated
- ✅ **Compatible**: Works with the latest GitHub Actions environment
- ✅ **Functional**: Supports SARIF output format for security reporting

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

The security job in the CI workflow should now:
1. **✅ Resolve the action** - No more "action not found" errors
2. **✅ Run security scanning** - Execute gosec against the codebase
3. **✅ Generate SARIF output** - Create security report file
4. **✅ Upload results** - Submit findings to GitHub Security tab

**The CI should now pass completely! 🎉**
