# Issues Directory

This directory contains documentation for significant issues, improvements, and their resolutions in the gRPC Beacon project.

## Directory Structure

Each issue is tracked in its own subdirectory with a unique identifier:

```
issues/
├── [issue_id]/
│   ├── README.md              # Issue overview and summary
│   ├── [ANALYSIS_PLAN].md     # Detailed analysis and solution plan
│   ├── [IMPLEMENTATION].md    # Implementation results and testing
│   └── [additional_files]     # Supporting files and documentation
```

## Issue Tracking Guidelines

### For New Issues
1. Create a new directory with format `[number]-[descriptive-name]`
2. Include a README.md with issue overview and status
3. Document analysis, solution plan, and implementation results
4. Update this index with the new issue

### Issue Lifecycle
- **OPEN**: Issue identified and being analyzed
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Solution being implemented
- **RESOLVED**: Issue fixed and verified
- **CLOSED**: Issue resolved and documentation archived

### Documentation Standards
- Clear problem description and root cause analysis
- Step-by-step solution implementation
- Testing and verification results
- Impact assessment and success metrics

This structured approach ensures comprehensive tracking of significant project improvements and provides valuable reference material for future development.
