# Issue #002: CI Workflow Fixes

## Overview
Fixed two failing CI checks caused by missing protocol buffer code generation in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Problem
The CI workflow was failing because:
1. **Missing generated code**: The workflow didn't generate protocol buffer code before running tests
2. **Missing buf tool**: The `buf` tool wasn't installed in the CI environment
3. **Dependency failures**: Tests and builds failed because generated Go files were missing

## Error Details
```
internal/health/serivce.go:11:2: no required module provides package github.com/troydai/grpcbeacon/gen/go/grpc/health/v1
internal/beacon/fx.go:8:2: no required module provides package github.com/troydai/grpcbeacon/gen/go/troydai/grpcbeacon/v1
```

## Root Cause
The CI workflow was missing the protocol buffer code generation step that creates the required Go files in `gen/go/`. The workflow tried to run tests and builds without these generated dependencies.

## Solution
Updated all CI workflow jobs to:
1. **Install buf tool**: `go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@latest`
2. **Generate protobuf code**: `make gen` before running tests/builds
3. **Applied to all jobs**: test, build, lint, and security jobs

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - All CI workflows now properly generate required code before running checks

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added buf installation and code generation steps to all 4 jobs
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish-server.yml` - Added buf installation and code generation before tests
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish-toolbox.yml` - Added buf installation and code generation before tests

## Additional Files
- [`FINAL_RESOLUTION.md`](./FINAL_RESOLUTION.md) - Complete resolution summary and verification

## Impact
- **Complete CI Success**: All 6 workflow jobs now have required generated code  
- **Consistent Environment**: All CI workflows match local development workflow
- **Reliable Builds**: Eliminates dependency failures in all automated workflows
- **Future-Proof**: Any protocol buffer changes will be automatically handled
