# Issue #001: Make Gen Target Fix

## Overview
This issue tracked the resolution of the failing `make gen` target in the gRPC Beacon project.

## Problem
The `make gen` target was failing with the error:
```
make: buf: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:21: gen] Error 127
```

## Root Cause
1. Missing `buf` command-line tool (Protocol Buffer compiler)
2. Go binary directory not in PATH
3. Architecture compatibility issue (x86_64 vs amd64)

## Solution
- **Immediate fix**: Installed `buf` tool and configured PATH
- **Long-term improvements**: Created automated setup script and enhanced developer experience

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Complete implementation with comprehensive improvements
