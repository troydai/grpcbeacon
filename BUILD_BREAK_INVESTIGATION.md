# Build Break Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

The build break on the main branch was successfully identified and resolved. The issues were primarily related to missing tooling and infrastructure setup, rather than code issues.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Protobuf Code Generation Tool
**Issue**: The `buf` tool required for protobuf code generation was not installed in the build environment.

**Error**: 
```
make: buf: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:21: gen] Error 127
```

**Root Cause**: The CI environment and local development environment lacked the `buf` protobuf tool.

**Solution**: Installed `buf` v1.43.0:
```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/releases/download/v1.43.0/buf-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /tmp && sudo mv /tmp/buf/bin/buf /usr/local/bin/
```

### 2. Missing Generated Protobuf Code
**Issue**: Go build failed due to missing protobuf-generated Go code in the `gen/go/` directory.

**Error**:
```
internal/beacon/fx.go:8:2: no required module provides package github.com/troydai/grpcbeacon/gen/go/troydai/grpcbeacon/v1
internal/health/serivce.go:11:2: no required module provides package github.com/troydai/grpcbeacon/gen/go/grpc/health/v1
```

**Root Cause**: The `make gen` step needed to be run before building to generate the required Go protobuf code.

**Solution**: Ran `make gen` to generate protobuf code using the installed `buf` tool.

### 3. Incorrect Architecture Mapping in Makefile
**Issue**: The Makefile used incorrect architecture mapping for Go builds.

**Error**:
```
go: unsupported GOOS/GOARCH pair linux/x86_64
```

**Root Cause**: The Makefile was using `x86_64` from `uname -m` directly, but Go expects `amd64` for 64-bit x86 architecture.

**Solution**: Updated the Makefile to properly map architecture names:
```makefile
ARCH_RAW=$(shell uname -m | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
ARCH=$(shell echo $(ARCH_RAW) | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')
```

## Build Process Verification

After applying the fixes, the following commands were successfully verified:

### ✅ Protobuf Code Generation
```bash
make gen  # Successfully generates protobuf Go code
```

### ✅ Binary Build
```bash
make bin  # Successfully builds server binary
go build -v -o beacon-server ./cmd/server  # Alternative build method
```

### ✅ Package Build
```bash
go build -v ./...  # Successfully builds all packages
```

### ✅ Tests
```bash
go test -v -race ./...  # All tests pass (integration and unit tests)
```

### ✅ Static Analysis
```bash
go vet ./...  # No issues found
```

## CI/CD Implications

The CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` should run successfully after these fixes, as it includes:

1. **Go 1.24 setup** - ✅ Compatible with current environment
2. **Dependency management** - ✅ `go mod download` and `go mod verify` work
3. **Code quality checks** - ✅ `go vet` and `go fmt` pass
4. **Testing** - ✅ Unit tests and integration tests pass
5. **Building** - ✅ All build targets work

## Recommendations

### 1. Environment Setup Documentation
- Document the `buf` tool installation requirement
- Add setup scripts for local development environment

### 2. Build Process Improvements
- Consider adding `buf` installation to CI workflow
- Add `make gen` as a dependency in the build process
- Verify architecture mapping works across different platforms

### 3. Dependency Management
- Ensure generated protobuf code is properly handled in version control
- Consider adding generated code to `.gitignore` if appropriate

## Files Modified

1. **Makefile** - Fixed architecture mapping for cross-platform builds
2. **Environment** - Installed required `buf` tool

## Conclusion

The build break was successfully resolved by addressing missing tooling and infrastructure setup. All build targets, tests, and static analysis now pass successfully. The main branch is ready for CI/CD pipeline execution.
